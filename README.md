#Resource Static Analysis
The Resource Static Analysis enables companies and localization suppliers to quickly add scalable validation checks to help ensure quality doesn't suffer as software and content is localized and data is exchanged between internal workflows and even between companies. The analysis engine is already in use by multiple teams at Microsoft, including Windows (WDG), Office (ASG), and Azure+SQL+VS (C&E).

This project also includes a complete sample that the Microsoft Office team is using to validate that sufficient resource context has been added by the developers in Word, Excel, OneNote, etc.. Validating the context ensures that those resources can be efficiently localized appropriately.

We are eager to engage and learn from this experience and may even end up Open Sourcing other parts of our localization related components and tooling, so your participation and feedback is greatly important to us!

##Goals for this project
Further enhance our common Resource Static Analysis toolbox, including supporting additional formats (such as XLIFF) and various validation rules. See also the [Roadmap](https://github.com/Microsoft/Resource-Static-Analysis/wiki/Roadmap).
